# aws-lambda-mean-stack

Creating an automated image to install Mean Stack and configure AWS Lambda.
This method would be using a docker image, hence the first thing that needs to be done

and post that use YAML to configure Webpack, using NPM, and install
all the necessary dependencies.


This Readme.md file will be updated as work on this progresses.
